---------------

Improved logging for multiple yaml
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is now possible to use a separate log file for each YAML if multiple are
provided. A folder can also be passed in which case separate log files will
be created with the corresponding YAML name.


Improved Report name
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For trace ability the report name will now also include the name of the
used config file.
